Date: April - June 2022
Main goal: to improve communication and management among the staff working in a school, especially during lunchtime and after-school activities.

Short-term goals:

1- OPTIMIZE TIMES:

Thanks to the creation of automated processes we can save time and even economic costs.

2- REDUCTION OF ERRORS DERIVED FROM INEFFICIENT COMMUNICATION FLOW:

Through easy and instant access to relevant information, we reduce the possibility of making mistakes at lunchtime and after-school activities.
